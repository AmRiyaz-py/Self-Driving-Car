+ In this notebook, we will implement the forward longitudinal vehicle model.
+ The model accepts throttle inputs and steps through the longitudinal dynamic equations. 
+ Once implemented, we will be given a set of inputs that drives over a small road slope to test our model.

+ Do refer Longitudinal Vehicle Dynamics PDF for reference and ramp.png

+ Longitudinal_Vehicle_OUTPUT.txt consist of the output result values.
